# Sentiment Lab: Production-Ready NLP Sentiment Analysis System

Sentiment Lab represents my approach to solving one of the most common yet challenging problems in modern AI: extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data. This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning engineering, from raw data processing to production-ready deployment.

## The Challenge

In today's data-driven world, organizations are overwhelmed with text data from social media, customer reviews, and feedback systems. Manual sentiment analysis is slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale. Teams need robust, automated solutions that can process thousands of text samples while maintaining accuracy and interpretability.

## Solution Architecture

Sentiment Lab is a modular, extensible sentiment analysis pipeline designed for production environments. The system transforms raw, noisy text into actionable sentiment predictions through a carefully engineered ML workflow.

### Core Components

**Data Ingestion Engine**
- Flexible CSV data loading with encoding handling
- Support for multiple data formats and sources
- Automated data validation and quality checks

**Advanced Text Preprocessing**
- NLTK-powered tokenization and normalization
- Intelligent stopword removal and filtering
- Custom text cleaning for domain-specific noise
- Unicode and encoding error handling

**Feature Engineering Pipeline**
- TF-IDF vectorization for semantic representation
- High-dimensional feature extraction with optimization
- Configurable vocabulary limits and n-gram support
- Memory-efficient sparse matrix operations

**Machine Learning Core**
- Multinomial Naive Bayes for fast, interpretable classification
- Automated train/validation splits with stratification
- Cross-validation support for robust model evaluation
- Extensible architecture for algorithm swapping

## Technical Implementation

```python
from pipeline import SentimentLab

pipeline = SentimentLab()
pipeline.train()
result = pipeline.predict("This product exceeded my expectations!")
# Output: 'positive'
```

**Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline**
- Automated text cleaning and normalization
- Smart handling of social media text (hashtags, mentions, URLs)
- Configurable preprocessing steps for different domains
- Robust error handling for malformed text

**Production-Ready Design**
