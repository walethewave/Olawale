# AI-Powered Sentence Completion for Video Game Narratives

This project represents my exploration into the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and interactive storytelling. As video games continue to evolve as a narrative medium, I wanted to investigate how modern NLP techniques could understand, predict, and generate contextually relevant text within gaming environments.

## Project Vision

Video games aren't just entertainment—they're immersive narrative experiences that shape player emotions and engagement. This project explores how AI can enhance and co-create these narratives by building an intelligent sentence completion system trained on diverse video game texts.

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Dataset Engineering
- Hand-curated dataset of video game narratives with emotional context annotations
- Diverse text sources including game scripts, lore entries, and narrative content
- Emotional labeling system for mood-aware text generation
- Structured data pipeline for scalable text processing

### NLP Pipeline Architecture
- **Text Preprocessing**: Advanced tokenization, normalization, and feature extraction
- **Sequence Generation**: Sliding window approach creating 5-word input sequences
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF vectorization for meaningful text representation
- **Model Training**: Multinomial Naive Bayes with probabilistic sampling for diverse outputs

### Key Technical Features
- **Contextual Prediction**: Next-word prediction with 5-word context windows
- **Creative Generation**: Auto-generates plausible game-style sentences
- **Emotion Integration**: Emotion-aware text generation for narrative tone control
- **Real-time Interface**: Interactive Streamlit demo for live sentence completion

## Technical Stack

**Core Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy
**Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
**Deployment**: Streamlit (interactive demo)
**NLP Techniques**: TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, Text Generation

## Model Performance & Results

The system demonstrates sophisticated understanding of gaming narrative patterns:

- **Contextual Accuracy**: Successfully predicts appropriate next words based on gaming context
- **Creative Output**: Generates grammatically correct, thematically consistent sentences
- **Emotional Awareness**: Incorporates emotional context for more nuanced text generation

### Example Generations
```
Input: "the hero must" → Output: "the hero must find the lost sword"
Input: "after the battle" → Output: "after the battle the village was silent"
Input: "choose your weapon" → Output: "choose your weapon wisely before the fight"
```

## Innovation & Impact

This project showcases several advanced AI engineering concepts:

### Custom Dataset Creation
Unlike using pre-existing datasets, I engineered a specialized corpus with emotional annotations, demonstrating data science expertise and domain knowledge.

### End-to-End Pipeline
From raw text collection through model deployment, this project represents complete ownership of the ML lifecycle.

### Creative AI Application
Applying NLP to creative content generation shows understanding of AI's potential beyond traditional analytics.

## Future Enhancements

**Advanced Architectures**: Integration of transformer models (BERT, GPT) for improved context understanding
**Extended Generation**: Expansion to paragraph and dialogue-level narrative creation
**Emotion-Driven Control**: Enhanced emotional modeling for narrative tone and pacing control
**Production Deployment**: Full web application with user feedback integration

## Key Achievements

✅ **Complete NLP Pipeline**: End-to-end development from data collection to deployment
✅ **Custom Dataset Engineering**: Specialized corpus creation with emotional annotations
✅ **Interactive Demo**: Real-time sentence completion with Streamlit interface
✅ **Modular Architecture**: Scalable, well-documented codebase for future enhancement
✅ **Creative AI Application**: Demonstrates AI's potential in content generation and storytelling

## Technical Learning Outcomes

This project deepened my expertise in:
- Advanced NLP preprocessing and feature engineering
- Probabilistic modeling and text generation techniques
- Custom dataset creation and annotation
- Interactive ML application development
- Creative applications of traditional ML algorithms

The combination of technical rigor and creative application makes this project a compelling demonstration of AI engineering skills applied to real-world narrative challenges.
