This project explores data analysis techniques, specifically focusing on factor analysis and linear regression, to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset. By employing factor analysis, we reduce the dimensionality of the data, identifying key variables that significantly impact the outcome. Following this, linear regression is utilized to model and predict relationships between the dependent and independent variables, providing insights into the dataâ€™s structure and enhancing predictive capabilities.
