# Dr. Amina — AI Healthcare for Northern Nigeria

Northern Nigeria faces a critical healthcare information gap: limited access to doctors, low health literacy, and language barriers that leave millions without reliable medical guidance. Dr. Amina was built to close that gap.

## What It Does

Dr. Amina is a multilingual AI healthcare assistant that answers medical questions using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** grounded in 648 verified health documents — not hallucinated medical advice. It combines:

- **Google Gemini AI** for natural language understanding and response generation
- **Pinecone vector database** for semantic search across the medical knowledge base
- **Emergency detection** using an LLM-based classifier with an 80% confidence threshold — directs users to the nearest hospital when it matters
- **Hausa voice input** via speech-to-text, because health literacy starts with language accessibility
- **Supabase chat persistence** so conversations carry context across sessions

## Architecture

```
User Query → Gemini Embedding → Pinecone Retrieval (top-k documents)
    → Context Assembly → Gemini Generation → Response
    → Emergency Classifier → Alert (if confidence ≥ 0.8)
```

The system uses a two-stage pipeline: first retrieve relevant medical documents via vector similarity, then generate a grounded response with the retrieved context injected into the prompt. Emergency detection runs in parallel on every query.

## Key Engineering Decisions

1. **No fine-tuning** — RAG was chosen over fine-tuning because medical accuracy requires traceable sources. Every response can be traced back to specific documents in the knowledge base.
2. **Confidence-gated emergency detection** — rather than keyword matching (which misses "my chest feels heavy"), the system uses Gemini to classify emergency severity and only triggers alerts above 80% confidence.
3. **Hausa-first design** — the voice input pipeline supports Hausa natively, not as an afterthought translation layer.
4. **Supabase for persistence** — lightweight, real-time database that handles chat history without the overhead of a full backend.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| LLM | Google Gemini AI |
| Vector DB | Pinecone |
| Backend | Python, Streamlit |
| Database | Supabase |
| Speech | Hausa voice-to-text |
| Deployment | Streamlit Cloud |

## Results

- **648 health documents** indexed and retrievable
- **Live deployment** serving real users via Streamlit
- **Sub-3 second** response times for most queries
- Built and deployed during the **DataFest Africa 2025 Hackathon**
