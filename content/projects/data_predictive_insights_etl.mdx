title: "Data Predictive Insights ETL Pipeline"
description: Built a full ETL pipeline that pulls powerlifting competition data, transforms it through Python, and loads it into PostgreSQL for analysis. Connected the whole thing to Power BI for interactive dashboards — turning raw Kaggle data into something a coach or athlete could actually use to spot trends in squat, bench, and deadlift performance.
