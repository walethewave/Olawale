title: "Bike-Sharing Optimization & Anomaly Detection"
description: Used SQL to reverse-engineer a bike-sharing system's operations — predicting peak demand, spotting anomalies in rider counts and revenue, and finding the operational sweet spots where efficiency meets profitability. Built interactive Power BI dashboards so operations teams can actually see when and where to deploy bikes instead of guessing.
